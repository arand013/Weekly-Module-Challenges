// CHALLENGE QUESTION

/*
-- Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions --
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

**************************
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
**************************

You can call or invoke this function by using its name 
followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out 
the message Hello World on the dev console. 
All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Create a function called "reusableFunction" which prints the string "Hi World" to the dev console.
Call the function.

//  TIPS & ADVICE

/*
(1) Every sentence(.) reveals more about how to solve the question.
(2) Begin by creating a console.log of the given to see and view what is happening as you progress. 

*/ 

// SOLUTION

function reusableFunction() {
    console.log("Hi World");
  }
   
  reusableFunction();
